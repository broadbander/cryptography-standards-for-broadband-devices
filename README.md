# cryptography standards for broadband.

## 1. Abstract
The main goal of this whitepaper is to provide an anlysis of the different cryptography standards for broadband, starting specifically with the use of PKCS#11 and their use in the administration of certificates and keys. 
It is not in my  ambition to provide blueprint to fully secure a broadband device, instead I provide the analysis to use different tools with examples of how to use them, giving generic use cases.
